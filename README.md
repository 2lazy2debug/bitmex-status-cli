# Bitmex-status-cli

###### Minimum Specifications

- Go 1.10 or 1.11
* Linux

  Go can be installed here : https://golang.org/doc/install.

###### setup
``cd ~/go/src/github.com/``

``git clone https://github.com/2lazy2debug/bitmex-status-cli``

``cd bitmex-status-cli``

###### API Key
You should put your API key in the bitmex.apikey file. If you decide to fork the project, there's already a reference in .gitignore.

Since it's kind of my first project in Golang, I'm not encrypting shit (api calls are in https of course) so... careful
