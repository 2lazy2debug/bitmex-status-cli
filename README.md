# Bitmex-status-cli

##### Work in progress - more to come SoonTM

##### Minimum Specifications

- Go 1.10 : https://golang.org/doc/install.
- Tested on Windows 10, Linux 18.10

##### Setup
``cd ~/go/src/github.com/``

``git clone https://github.com/2lazy2debug/bitmex-status-cli``

``cd bitmex-status-cli``

##### API Key
You should put your API key in a bitmex.apikey file on the same level as main.go. If you decide to fork the project, there's already a reference in .gitignore.

Since it's kind of my first project in Golang, I'm not encrypting shit (api calls are in https of course) so... careful

Syntax : 
``id:myverypersonalbitmexid``
``secret:myveryveryverypersonalbitmexsecret``
``Add a line break``
